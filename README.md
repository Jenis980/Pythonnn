# Python Learning Repository

A collection of Python code examples and exercises covering fundamental concepts, data structures, object-oriented programming, file handling, testing, and more. This repository serves as a practical guide for learning Python through hands-on coding.

## Topics Covered

- **Variables and Data Types**: Basic data types, operations, and string manipulation
- **Lists and Dictionaries**: Working with collections and key-value pairs
- **Control Flow**: If statements, loops, and conditional logic
- **Functions**: Defining and using functions, parameters, and return values
- **Classes and Inheritance**: Object-oriented programming concepts
- **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to files, exception handling
- **Testing**: Unit testing with Python's unittest framework
- **Modules and Packages**: Organizing code into reusable modules
